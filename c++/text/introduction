1. What  is the difference between C and C++ ?
	C is procedure oriented language. 
	C++ is object oriented language. 
	C is less concerned about the data which it is handling. Where in C++ 
	data and functions are bound  together , and only those functions 
	can operate on that data.
2. OOPS concepts: Object Oriented Programming concepts
   1. Encapsulation
   	Binding data and methods together is called encapsulation. 
   2. Abstraction
   	Hinding some data memebers and exposing only the required members 
   	is called abstraction. In C++ anstarction is achieved by "public "
   	and "private" access specifiers. 
   3. Inheritance
        Aquiring the parent properties by child is called inheritance.
   	
   4. Polymorphism
   	Different behaviour of the method or operator in different situations 
   	is called polymorphism. 
   5.class:
   	A class is a blue print  or the prototype of the objects which are 	   created. It contains all the data and methods which are common to the objects of that class. 
   6.Object:
   	An object is an instantiation of the class.
