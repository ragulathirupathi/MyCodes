Signal:
	A signal is a asyncronous evnt that is sent by the kernel to the user space process. A signal can be genarated by the process when it is encuntered a coundition called devide by zero. A signal
can be sent by one process to another process also. when we press CTRL+C the signal is sent to the user process by the kernel to terminae it. A signal can be sent by the child to the parent process. 
A signal is also part of the inter process communication. 

Different Signals:

S.No      Signal     Description                            Default action

1.       SIGABRT    generated by system call abort()          Terminate with core dump
2.       SIGALRM    generated by alarm() call                 Terminate
3.       SIGCHLD    child has terminated                      Ignored.
4.       SIGFPE     Arithematic execption                     Terminate with core dump 
5.       SIGHUP     Prcoess controlling terminal has
		    closed mostely , user logged out          Terminated

6.       SIGKILL    Uncatchable process termination           Terminate
7.       SIGBUS     The kernel genrates this signal 
		    when process wrongly access the memory
                    pointed by mmap()                         If not caught terminates with core dump

8.       SIGILL    This is generated when the process 
		   executes a illeagal machine instruction.   Terminate with copre dump.
9.       SIGINT    The signal is sent to all foreground process
		   when the user generates this seganl        
                   (CTRL + C)                                 Default behaviour is to terminate but user can catch this signal.

10.     SIGPIPE    The process writes the pipe. But the 
			reader has terminated.               Default action is to terminate the process, but this can be catched. 

11.     SIGQUIT    The signal is generated by the kernel to
                   all processes  when 			      Deafult action is terminate the process with core dump. 
		   the user use the chanratcer ctrl + \ 

12.     SIGSEGV    This signal is generated when delaing with 
		   unmapped memory, poniter arithmatic        


User defined signals SIGUSR1 SIGUSER2 these are the user defined signal the kernel never uses it, the default action is to terminate the process.





                  
#include<signal.h>

typedef void (*sighandler_t)(int signal);  =>Delcaration of the function pointer which takes 'int' as parameter and return 'void'


sighandler_t signal(int signal, sihandler_);






-------------------------------------------------
#include<unistd.h>
pause()=> the system call wait until the signal is received by the process.
